⚫⚪ Othello Game (Reversi)
📌 Project Overview
This is a Python implementation of the Othello (Reversi) game, supporting both console-based and GUI-based gameplay using Tkinter. The game includes AI opponents with different difficulty levels, using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making.

🔑 Features
✅ Play in Console or GUI mode
✅ Human vs Human and Human vs AI Modes
✅ AI with different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
✅ Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for AI
✅ Valid move detection and tile flipping mechanics

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter
AI Algorithm: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
